# loan-default-risk-eda
Exploratory Data Analysis project to identify drivers of loan default for risk analytics
Loan Default Risk Analysis – EDA

A data analysis project to identify patterns that differentiate loan defaulters from non-defaulters using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to help financial institutions make better lending decisions.
Project Summary

This project explores customer and loan attributes to understand the factors that influence default behavior. Using EDA techniques, we analyse missing values, outliers, data imbalance, and relationships between key variables.

Key Insights (Brief)

Income, employment stability, and loan amount show strong patterns related to default.

Defaulted clients often show higher risk scores and shorter employment duration.

The dataset is highly imbalanced — most customers repay on time.
